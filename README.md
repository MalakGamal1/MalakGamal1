I’m a third-year Information Technology student at Assiut University, passionate about networking and cybersecurity. I have earned my CCNA certification from NTI and completed Linux Admin 1, strengthening my foundation in network administration and system management.

Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in network security to understand how to build and protect secure network infrastructures. I enjoy solving complex networking challenges at Tryhackme and continuously seek opportunities to grow in the field.
